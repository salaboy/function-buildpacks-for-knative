# Function Buildpacks for Knative

Enables a FaaS experience for Knative / Cloud Native Runtimes.

Will soon extend [func](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func) to create deployable functions via CLI.

## Pre-Requisites
- [Buildpack CLI](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) or [Cloud Native Runtimes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes-1-0/GUID-cnr-overview.html)

## Currently Supported
* Python
* Java (Spring)

## Future
* NodeJS
* .NET
* Rust

## Usage
The buildpacks in this repository have been built, published, and included in the builder. 

The builder is also built and published as an image to `gcr.io` -- to build an image from source, simply use the builder as shown below.

For example:
```
pack build <image_name> --path /path/to/function --builder us.gcr.io/daisy-284300/kn-fn/builder:0.0.1
```

For more details you can refer to language-specific documentation:
* Python
    * [Buildpack/Function details](./buildpacks/python/README.md)
    * [Samples](./samples/python)
    * [Templates](./templates/python)
* Java (Alpha)
    * [Buildpack/Function details](./buildpacks/java/README.md)
    * [Samples](./samples/java)
    * [Templates](./templates/java)


## Creating the Builder from Source

1. Build the buildpacks
```
make buildpacks
```
TODO: Tag specific versions rather than depending on latest

1. Build the builder
```
make builder
```
Note the builder name in the output. Use this local builder in the `pack build` command similarly to above.


## Documentation
Each subdirectory has a relevant README.md describing how to use its respective files.
